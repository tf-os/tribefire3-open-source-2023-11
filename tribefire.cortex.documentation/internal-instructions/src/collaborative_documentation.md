# Collaborative Markdown Documentation

The philosophy of collaborative markdown documentation is to have interdepending building blocks that can be reused, versioned and maintained and released independently.

[All common markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is supported. We also added a few proprietary extensions to link between the various parts of the documentation.

Please read on in the following chapters
* [Structure](content/structure.md) - How to structure your collaborative markdown documentation
* [Markdown extensions](content/links.md) - How to link between structural elements
* [Conventions](content/conventions.md) - Style- and naming recommendations
