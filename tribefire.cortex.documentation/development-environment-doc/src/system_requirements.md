# System Requirements

Your machine must meet the system requirements to smoothly run Tribefire.

## General

tribefire can be installed in a variety of systems. At its core, it is contained in a JEE Container, and all cartridges, clients, and core services deployed there. braintribe recommends that you use Tomcat as your container of choice, and our installer will automatically deploy tribefire within this container. However, it is also possible to use other solutions, if so required.

As tribefire is based on Java it can be deployed to any operating system.
