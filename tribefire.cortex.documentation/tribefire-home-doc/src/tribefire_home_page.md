# Tribefire
Tribefire (TF) is a platform for implementing technical solutions that require the collaboration of multiple teams and processes. It generates model-based and service-oriented APIs and interfaces that support collaborative modeling and provide multi-persistence solutions on top of common database management systems (like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and others).

The main goals of Tribefire as a platform are modeling and data integration. This provides a new technical space for domain-agnostic, model-driven engineering.

Tribefire is a horizontal (cross domain) solution that you can use to build vertical (domain specific) solutions. 

It comes with a set of built-in services and an easily extendable basis, allowing the implementation of your customised services.


Tribefire enables you to:
* Create, configure, import, and export models with [Tribefire Explorer](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:concepts-doc/features/ui-clients/explorer.md).
* Connect models to databases with Tribefire connections and accesses. See [Data Integration](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:concepts-doc/features/data-integration/data_integration.md).
* Build your own applications to extend Tribefire with Tribefire extensions. See [Developing Tribefire-based App](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:tutorials-doc/development/introduction.md), [Service Processor](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:concepts-doc/features/service-model/service_processor.md), and [State Change Processor](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:concepts-doc/features/tribefire-extensions/state_change_processor.md).
