# Developing with Tribefire
Hello, welcome to the Tribefire tutorial!  

In this tutorial we're going to create a Tribefire service where the user can specify a sentence and gets the processed sentence back, transformed to UPPERCASE or lowercase.  
The service in this tutorial will be called via:
1. The generic REST endpoint
2. Servide side Web-app using a __Web Terminal__ representing Servlet in Java
3. Client side Web-app using a __JxUxAsset__ representing JavaScript/HTML5 application

In order to get started please refer to:

* [Installing Development Tools](components.md) where we download, install, and configure the tools we need
* [Creating Artifacts](creating_artifacts.md) where we create a Maven based artifact group and its constituent artifacts (assets)
* [Developing Artifacts](developing_artifacts.md) where we set up our IDE and create our logic in accordance to Braintribe conventions.
