# Creating a Process Definition
You define the flow of your process using Process Designer. The process designer is a GUI tool that allows you to design the process definition, done through the creation of two main elements: nodes and edges.

## Creating a Dataflow Process Definition

To create a dataflow process definition:

1. In Control Center, go to **Definitions** and click **New**.
2. Provide a `name` and click **Apply**. Process Designer opens.
3. Define your process by creating nodes. 

>For an example process definition, see the video in the [General](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:concepts-doc/features/dataflow-engine/dataflow_engine_components.md#general) section of [Dataflow Engine Components](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:concepts-doc/features/dataflow-engine/dataflow_engine_components.md).
