Jinni is an application used to set up Tribefire by evaluating platform setup requests. You can pass service requests to Jinni with the command line or using a JSON file. Jinni is necessary to work with platform assets.

Note that Jinni uses Maven to resolve dependencies, so configuring your Maven settings correctly is necessary for Jinni to work.

To set up Jinni:
1. Configure Apache Maven as described below. [](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:includes-doc/maven_installation.md?INCLUDE&collapsed)
2. Download the Jinni package. For information on where do download Tribefire components from, see below. [](asset://tribefire.cortex.documentation:includes-doc/resources.md?INCLUDE&collapsed)
3. Unzip the downloaded archive to a location of your choice (e.g. `/development/jinni`).
4. Add jinni's bin folder (e.g. `/development/jinni/bin`) to the `PATH` variable of your operating system.
