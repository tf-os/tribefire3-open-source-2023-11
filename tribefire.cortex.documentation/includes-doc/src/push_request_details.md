`clientIdPattern` |  A regular expression matching the registered client IDs. The request will only be sent to those client IDs that match the expression, for example, using `tribefire-control-center.auth` as the value means the request will be pushed only to Control Center instances in the `auth` access. <br/> <br/> This is a regular expression, so you might have to escape certain characters with `/`.
