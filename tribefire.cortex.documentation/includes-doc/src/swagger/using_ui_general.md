## General
Our Swagger UI implementation helps you understand and try out the REST API endpoints.

The UI allows you to:

* see all available operations on entities, properties and service requests in a given service domain (access)
* see REST API documentation for calls and their parameters
* send REST API calls to various endpoints directly from your browser
* download a Swagger definition file

The REST API is automatically exposed for every deployed model.
