When developing in Java (or creating a model using Modeler), the allowed property types are as follows:

* An entity type deployed to a tribefire model
* An enumeration from a tribefire model
* `Object` which can be any item from the list. It's especially useful when you don't know what the property value type will be, for example user input can be a String or an integer.
* `Boolean`
* `Date`
* `Decimal`
* `Double`
* `Float`
* `Integer`
* `Long`
* `String`
* `List`
* `Set`
* `Map`
>A collection of collections, for example a `List` of `List` objects, is not allowed.
