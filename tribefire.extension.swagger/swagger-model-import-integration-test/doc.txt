This artifact provides swagger-model-import-module related integration tests. They require a running tribefire with proper swagger-model-import-module setup.
This means the module has to be detected, models have to be synchronized and deployables have to be configured and deployed.
Afterwards the tests can be run from the IDE just like any unit test.
