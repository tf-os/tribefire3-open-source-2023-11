# Environment-Aware Classic Setups
This repository provides environment-aware variants of the classic tribefire setups. Environment-aware means that - dependent on the environment where tribefire is deployed, e.g. Cloud/Kubernetes - certain dependencies such the etcd-module are added automatically. This makes sure that developers don't have to care about these environment-specific dependencies.
