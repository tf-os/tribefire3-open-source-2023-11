# Model Browser

Just include the `model-browser-setup` dependence into your project,
start tomcat and navigate to
`https://localhost:8443/tribefire-services/component/model-browser` to
start the Model Browser. The search boxes support
*Camel-Case-Completion*, thus, entering `AWT` will find
`AuthorizableWebTerminal` etc.

The Model Browser allows to explor the hirachy and genealogy of all
available models:

  - direct and indirect dependencies,
  - namespaces,
  - super types,
  - sub types,
  - usages,
  - properties.
