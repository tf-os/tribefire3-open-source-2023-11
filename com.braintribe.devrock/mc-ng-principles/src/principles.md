# Principles of mc-ng : a collection of asserted documents

This documentation contains some text that illuminates some basic principles used within mc-ng. It stands alone, as it's relevant for all exposures of mc-ng, be it in the tooling or even tribefire itself.


## About artifacts
- How artifacts are [identified](./principles/identifications.md) in mc-core.
- How artifacts are [represented](./principles/multilevel.md) in mc-core
- How artifacts are [validated](./principles/validity.md) in mc-core
- How artifact [versions](./principles/versions.md) are represented and processed in mc-core


## About the persisted data 
- How the [local indexes](./principles/footprint.md) are maintained, i.e. what traces are left by mc-core in your filesystem

## About the analysis data 
- How to [interpret AnalysisArtifactResolutions](./principles/howToAnalyzeResolutions.md)
- How to [interpret Reasons](./principles/reasons.md)

## Rationales
- [Why mc-ng](./principles/why.not.maven.md) (rather than sticking to plain-vanilla Maven)?
