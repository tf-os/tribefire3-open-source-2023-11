More about how the REST api works, and how it is detected is [here](../configuration/probing.md).


## availability reflection 
There is a feature in the intermediate-tier that allows to programmatically access the availability information on an artifact basis. This is explained in [how to find parts of an artifact](asset://com.braintribe.devrock:mc-ng-tutorials/howToFindPartsOfArtifacts.md).

You'll find more information about the location and the format of the persited index files [here](asset://com.braintribe.devrock:mc-ng-principles/principles/footprint.md).
