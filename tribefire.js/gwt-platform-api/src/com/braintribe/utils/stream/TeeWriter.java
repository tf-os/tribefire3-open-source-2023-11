/**
 * This class is a wrapper around a provided Writer. All actions are invoked with the
 * delegate Writer. 
 * The functionality of this wrapper is that it additionally writes the content to a secondary ("tee") writer.
 * Output to the secondary Writer can be stopped irrevocably by invocing {@link #stopTee()}.
 * This implementation will first try to write the content to the tee Writer and then
 * to the main delegate Writer. If the tee Writer throws an exception, the data will not be written to the 
 * delegate Writer. If the delegate Writer throws an Exception, the tee Writer has already gotten the information.
