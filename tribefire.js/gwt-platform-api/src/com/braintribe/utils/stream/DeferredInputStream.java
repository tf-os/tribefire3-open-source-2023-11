/**
 * <p>
 * A wrapper {@link InputStream} which supports late binding of the delegate it wraps.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Calls to {@code InputStream} methods on this class will block until another thread responsible for providing the
 * delegate invokes {@link #setDelegate(Supplier, boolean, boolean)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the delegate is set as incremental, read operations on this object might block on end-of-file reads from the
 * delegate {@code InputStream} until this object is notified by thread responsible for the delegate integrity that the
 * underlying data is available on its entirely (see {@link #markDelegateAsComplete(long)}). The method
 * {@link #isComplete()} can be called at any time to verify if the underlying data is fully available.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Having the underlying data available on its entirely, this class might support re-opening {@link InputStream} for it
 * through {@link #reopen()} . Whether the underlying data supports repeated reads is determined upon the delegate
 * setting (see {@link #setDelegate(Supplier, boolean, boolean)}) and can be checked any time after that through
 * {@link #isReopenable()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The methods available to set and update the status of the delegate ({@link #setDelegate(Supplier, boolean, boolean)},
 * {@link #markDelegateAsComplete(long)} and {@link #markDelegateAsInvalid(Throwable)}) are thread-safe, whereas the
 * {@code InputStream} methods are not.
