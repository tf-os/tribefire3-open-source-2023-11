/**
 * This is a little helper class that provides an alternative to suppressing certain warnings related to unused code via
 * {@link SuppressWarnings} annotation. Why do you need this? Well, you don't. You can always suppress via annotation,
 * if needed. Some developers don't like that approach though.<br>
 * In the following example, the created <code>URL</code> is not used, but this is not a bug. The code just makes sure
 * that the constructor doesn't throw an exception, which means that the <code>urlString</code> is valid.
 *
 * <pre>
 * try {
 * 	new URL(urlString);
 * } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
 * 	throw new IllegalArgumentException("The specified string '" + urlString + "' is not a valid URL!");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * To be able to suppress the warning (just for that line) one has to declare a variable:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;SuppressWarnings("unused")
 * URL url = new URL(urlString);
 * </pre>
 *
 * In addition, it probably makes sense to add a comment explaining this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#47;&#47; create URL to validate URL string
 * &#64;SuppressWarnings("unused")
 * URL url = new URL(urlString);
 * </pre>
 *
 * This class provides an alternative, where one just writes:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Unused.butConstructorMayThrowException(urlString);
 * </pre>
 *
 * With this approach the code briefly explains why something is unused. The Javadoc provides further information.
 * Therefore this is more descriptive than just <code>&#64;SuppressWarnings</code> and usually descriptive enough so
 * that one doesn't have to further explain in a comment.<br>
 * On the other hand most developers, obviously, are not used to this pattern. Therefore the annotation might still be
 * better choice. But this is an alternative.
