/**
 * Helper class that makes it easy to let classes from a class hierarchy share the same <code>Logger</code> (from the
 * sub class).
 * <p>
 * Example: let's assume we have a class called <code>DeleteFileRequestProcessor</code> which is responsible for
 * deleting files as specified by a certain request. The actual code for deleting the file is in that class. However,
 * there is also code shared between all file-related processors and that is implemented in super class
 * <code>AbstractFileRequestProcessor</code>. Furthermore some common helpers for all requests, e.g. printing the
 * request description, is provided by <code>AbstractRequestProcessor</code>.
 * <p>
 * There are multiple options for how to do the logging in such as scenario:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sub classes use logger from the super class: To do this, one just declares a <code>protected</code>
 * <code>Logger</code> in the super class, i.e. <code>AbstractRequestProcessor</code> and lets sub classes use it. This
 * is straight-forward to implement, but one always sees the name of the super class in the log, which is often not the
 * intention.
 * <li>Each class uses its own <code>Logger</code>: Each class has its own <code>private</code> <code>Logger</code>.
 * This is also easy and means that one will see all the different class names in the log. (If that's what you want,
 * stop reading now and just do it. There is nothing wrong about it!)</li>
 * <li>Super classes use logger from sub class: That way general request processing methods from super types (such as
 * printing request details) will still be logged with the name of the sub class
 * (<code>DeleteFileRequestProcessor</code>) in the log. One approach to achieve the third solution is to define an
 * abstract method <code>logger()</code> which returns the logger. This works, but all sub classes have to implement it.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * The <code>HasSharedLogger</code> makes implementing the last approach more convenient. The common super class, in our
 * example <code>AbstractRequestProcessor</code> just has to extend <code>HasSharedLogger</code>. It can then use the
 * <code>protected</code> {@link #logger} for logging. The concrete sub types, in our case
 * <code>DeleteFileRequestProcessor</code>, just declare a <code>private static</code> {@link Logger} field named
 * {@value #LOGGER_FIELD} (as usual). This is needed for logging from <code>static</code> methods. If that's not
 * required, there is nothing to do at all in the sub classes.
