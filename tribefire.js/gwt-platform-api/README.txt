The PlatformApi provides common tools classes, interfaces, exceptions, etc. that may be used by any other BT artifact. It contains platform independent code, i.e. code that runs on GWT and Java, and also Java-only code. The packages with platform independent code use the suffix ".lcd", e.g. "com.braintribe.utils.lcd". LCD stands for "Least/Lowest Common Denominator". It indicates that it's a compromise between GWT-code (where GWT libraries could be used) and Java-Code (where one could use reflection, etc.). For more information please check BTT-1587.
