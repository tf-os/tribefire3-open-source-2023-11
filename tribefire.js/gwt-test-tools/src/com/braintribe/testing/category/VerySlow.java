/**
 * Signals that the respective test is expected to take a very long time to execute (e.g. more than 5 minutes). This
 * information can, for example, be used by continuous integration pipelines to exclude these tests not just from pull
 * requests, but also from regular periodic builds (which run every few hours). Instead the test will only be run as
 * part of special, e.g. nightly or weekly tests.
 *
 * Whether or not to mark a test as <code>VerySlow</code> not only depends on the expected execution time though, but
 * also on the importance of the test and how many other very (slow) tests there are. It may absolutely make sense to
 * include a very slow test in periodic builds, if it is important and if there aren't too many others. For further
 * information see {@link Slow}.
 *
 * By marking a test as <code>VerySlow</code> one basically signals that the test is very slow AND that it thus should
 * only be run when testing time doesn't really matter.
