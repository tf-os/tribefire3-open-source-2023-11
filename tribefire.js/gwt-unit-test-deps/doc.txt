This artifact bundles dependencies that are usually/often needed when implementing unit tests.
This includes the JUnit library, general testing tools as well as custom assertions.

The purpose of this artifact is to have a convenient way of getting all required testing deps.
That way one also doesn't have to think about artifact versions.

Note that this artifact does not include any GM dependencies.
For GM tests one should use com.braintribe.testing:GmUnitTestDeps instead.
