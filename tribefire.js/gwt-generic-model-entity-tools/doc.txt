This artifact provides GenericEntity related tools. It only depends on the RootModel and the PlatformApi.
The purpose of this artifact is to give other artifacts access to some GenericEntity related classes
without adding any other dependencies. This in some cases makes it possible to decouple from GmCore (e.g. via EntityInstantiator),
making it less likely that the artifact has to be branched.
