The TestModel is a generic model that can be used to test and debug all kinds of GM features.
For example, for a test cases that tests whether an access supports all simple types,
instead of creating a new entity, one can just use
com.braintribe.testing.model.test.technical.features.SimpleTypesEntity.

The TestModel includes entities that show the usage of:
.) all simple types
.) all primitives
.) enums
.) collections
.) (multiple) inheritance
.) abstract (i.e uninstantiable) entities
.) selective information
.) initializers
.) very long entity/property names, entities with many properties, many enum constants, etc.
.) etc.
