This artifact bundles dependencies that are often/usually needed when implementing unit tests for GM code.
This includes several GM dependencies, GM-specific test tools and assertions as well as general UnitTestDeps (see below).

The purpose of this artifact is to have a convenient way of getting all required testing deps.
That way one also doesn't have to think about artifact versions.

For tests that do not require GM dependencies one should use com.braintribe.testing:UnitTestDeps instead.
