# Service Model

## General
Like any object in tribefire, services are also modeled. Because of this, the same principles which are applied to <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.model}}">models</a> that define data can be applied to models that define services. This leads to a microservices-like approach as each service is provided using a model and its own API. Even though they are separate from each other, a service model usually depends on the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.business_model}}">business model</a>.
