# Explorer
>Explorer is used as a data browser allowing you to create sample data, validate integrated data, or simply explore the data.

## General
Explorer is used for checking data associated with any custom access implemented. The purpose of Explorer is to validate, manipulate or review data integrated from the system from a third party. An additional feature is the use of Explorer in combination with <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.simulation_mode}}">simulation mode</a>. The use of Explorer allows the addition of test data that can be then used during the creation of a front-end application, or even to test the validity of your model.

By default, opening an custom access in Explorer displays an empty client. There are no links shown at the left-hand side of the screen, as there are with  Control Center. This means the layout of the GUI representation of you access in the client can be designed using a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.workbench}}">workbench</a> assigned to the access.
