Metadata Property Name  | Type Signature  
------- | -----------
`Emphasized` | `com.braintribe.model.meta.data.display.Emphasized`

## General

You can configure the emphasis by setting of the Boolean value to either `true` or `false`, which can be done via the Emphasized property of the metadata. If emphasized each instance will be displayed in **bold**.

There are only two accepted values for this metadata property, either `true` or `false`. This choice is represented by a checkbox, which when checked means that the entity type is emphasized. If the checkbox is not checked, instances of this entity type will be displayed as normal text.
