# Classic Setups
This repository provides classic tribefire setups. They are called classic, because they resemble feature sets which have been used in many projects for many years.

The `web-platform-setup` (previously called `tribefire-web-platform-aggregator`) provides a tribefire setup with support for many important features such as Hibernate Access, Smart Access, Process Engine, OpenApi, etc.
The `standard-setup` (previously called `tribefire-standard-aggregator`) also adds the tribefire-explorer and related dependencies such as workbenches.
