// elasticsearch not only uses log4j-api (which is fine), but actually also uses classes from log4j-core.
// this is not good (not at all!), because this prevents us from bridging to slf4j (via log4j-to-slf4j).
// unfortunately elasticsearch uses a lot of log4j classes, thus there doesn't seem to be an easy fix.
// however, by marking log4j dependencies as private here we can at least make sure that other modules
// (which also use log4j) can be bridged as usual.
