This artifact provides ElasticsearchCartridge related integration tests. They require a running tribefire with proper ElasticsearchCartridge setup.
This means the cartridge has to be detected, models have to be synchronized and deployables have to be configured and deployed.
Afterwards the tests can be run from the IDE just like any unit test.
