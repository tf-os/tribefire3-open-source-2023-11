# Zarathud/Zed/'ed documentation

Zarathud is a tool that analyzes compiled Java classes (artifacts) and can create several kind of reports from it - access of duplicate classes in the classpath, dependency issues, model issues, module requirements ... It is still in an experimental state, but what it can extract out of the Java pseudo compiled code is quite useful eve^n in this unfinished state. 

It can be run via Java directly (Junit for instance) or via its integration into Jinni, ANT and Eclipse (Devrock plugin).
