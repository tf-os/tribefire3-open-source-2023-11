# About TribefireJS

`tribefire.js` is a JavaScript library allowing you to use tribeﬁre functionality through JavaScript.

Using tribefire.js you can easily implement HTML5 applications with active tribeﬁre objects and consume the tribeﬁre core Java API.

Tribefire is shipped with two versions of the JavaScript library you can use in your application:

* runtime
* debug

The runtime version is an obfuscated, compressed, and faster version, while the debug version is more verbose, therefore making it better for debugging.

## Runtime

## Debug

## Examples
