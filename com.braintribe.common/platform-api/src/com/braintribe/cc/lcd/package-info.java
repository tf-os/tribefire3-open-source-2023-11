 * This package provides classes for the use of the hash redirection collections such as : <br/>
 * {@link com.braintribe.cc.lcd.CodingSet} - a set that can use a generic set, but redirects hashCode and equals <br/>
 * {@link com.braintribe.cc.lcd.CodingIterator} - an iterator that handles a {@link com.braintribe.cc.lcd.CodingSet} <br/>
 * {@link com.braintribe.cc.lcd.CodingMap} - a map that can use a generic map, but redirects hashCode and equals<br/>
 * {@link com.braintribe.cc.lcd.HashSupportWrapperCodec} - an abstract codec that only needs the hashCode and equals function implemented and does the
 * rest. <br/>
