You can debug devrock-ant-tasks remotely.

1. Install devrock-ant-tasks locally (Optional)
	You can do this via command line from the root folder of devrock-ant-tasks:
		ant toant
	
	WARNING:
		This simply puts new devrock-at-tasks libs in your ant's lib folder, but because there already are those 'bt.xyz.jar' files, if you are
		installing a higher version of some of them, the lower version stays.
	
	RECOMMENDED
		First time replace the jars in your ant lib manually.

		Go to ANT's lib folder and delete all the `bt.xyz.jar` files (e.g. `bt.root-model-2.0.1.jar`)
		
		Prepare new `bt.xyz.jar`s with 
			ant assemble
		
		Copy the bt jars from `dist/archive` to ANT's lib folder

		After this you can refresh using `ant toant`

2. Make sure your terminal starts ant in remote-debug mode: 	

	Unix / GitBash / cygwin 
		ANT_OPTS='-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y'

	Windows
		set ANT_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=y

	NOTE:
		The "suspend=y" at the end means the JVM will wait for a remote connection before it starts executing the code. This is useful when you don't
		have time to connect remotely before the code you are interested in would be executed, but might be annoying if you don't want to debug every
		single time you start the program. Just change it to "suspend=n" in that case.
